                      Through user research, we uncovered how discouraged wheelchair users are from traveling to new places. Airlines often damage their $2,000+ wheelchairs, they have to wait around for days for wheelchair replacements. Also,loading a wheelchair on and off a plane can be time consuming. Going through security at the airport can also be degrading as they have to be lifted from their chairs and patted down extensively.
                      Wheelchair users develop an “I can’t” mentality due to the limited and inconsistent accessibility infrastructure around them.

                      Sherpa is the first stage in motivating wheelchair users to explore their local area, and hence break free from the "I can't" mentality. Sherpa gives you the option to explore alone or meet other wheelchair users in group tours.

                      Our primary method used for design research was interviews. We felt that interviews were the best way to design for real people, who have insight into how they perceive travel. These participants revealed pain points, and attitudes, that guided our design and allowed us to focus on a more specific goal. The personalized focus in the interviews allowed us to hone in on the focus of our project: encouraging wheelchair users to break out of an “I can’t” mentality. In addition to interviews, we also made use of other methods on the side such as participant observation (i.e how wheelchair users board a bus: what are pain points there) and directed stories (i.e through wheelchair travel blogs).

                      We started exploring our solution by creating a storyboard to show the who and where of our product. Then, we created our initial paper prototype. After a heuristic evaluation and first usability test with a wheelchair user, we made a design iteration. We made another after 2 more usability tests. Then, we mocked our prototype in Balsamiq as a more cartoonish mockup. Then we finally refined the colors and designs to make the app truly stunning by doing a digital mockup in Origami.
